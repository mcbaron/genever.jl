# [filterbank, bpFreqs, bandStop] = mkbank(Fl, Fh, Fs, lenFreq, octaves, order, overlap)
# Create a filterbank with zero phase linkwitz-riley
# fl - low freq
# fh - high freq (if fl=fh or fh is empty only one filter is returned around fl)
# Fs - sample rate (default 44100)
# lenFreq - frequency length, assumes to Nyquist (4097)
# octaves - octaves to smooth
# order - order of butterworth (doubled as LR)
# overlap - number of times to overlap filters

# filterbank - output
# bpFreqs - array of low & high freqs for each filter
# bandStop - lowpass & high pass outside filterbank
